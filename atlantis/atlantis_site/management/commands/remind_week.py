"""DM everyone who's still short on Saturday evening, with how much is left.

A nudge, not a verdict: it goes to whoever is in the program and hasn't filled
this week's bar, a day and a bit before the week closes (weeks.reminder_at),
and says exactly how much time they still need to track.

Safe to run as often as you like. Before Saturday 6pm Eastern it does nothing,
and a WeekReminder row means each person hears once a week however many times
it runs after that — so the scheduler runs it every few minutes and it catches
up by itself if the container was down at six.

Week 1 gets no reminder: it's judged together with week 2 (weeks.GRACE_WEEKS),
so nothing is actually due when it ends. Week 2's reminder is about the pair's
ten hours.
