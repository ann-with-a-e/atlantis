"""When the challenge weeks run, and which one a moment falls in.

Pure date arithmetic: nothing here touches the database, so it can be imported
from models.py, from views, and from the management command without a cycle.
The ledger built on top of it lives in challenge.py.

Two clocks are in play and conflating them is the bug this module exists to
prevent. Every timestamp in the database is UTC (settings.TIME_ZONE), but a
week is a *local* Monday-to-Sunday in settings.CHALLENGE_TIMEZONE, and the two
are neither the same instant nor a fixed distance apart: US Eastern shifts by
an hour on the first Sunday in November, which on the default schedule falls
inside week 6. So boundaries are built by combining a local date with local
midnight and attaching the zone, never by adding a timedelta to an aware
datetime — the latter would put weeks 7 and 8 an hour out.

The program is `CHALLENGE_WEEKS` weeks long. Anything before week 1 opens is
"prep", which pays the old flat rate; anything after the last week closes is
past the end of the program, when shipping is off.
